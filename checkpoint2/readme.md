# Bucketlist API

## Introduction
* The bucketlist application API is built on top of `Flask` and uses several `libraries` to enhance its functionality.
* The `libraries` in use include;
   * **`passlib`** - It's used to hash the user's plain text password. Also used to identify a user from a given token
   * **`itsdangerous`** - It's used to generate tokens from users and identify users from tokens.
   * **`Flask-RESTful`** - It's used to organise resources into class based views.
   * **`Flask-HttpAuth`** - It's used to handle user authentication. This API improvises this library's features to help authenticate users via tokens. It also performs serializations on models during get requests.
   * **`sqlalchemy`** - The ORM that's used to transate database tables into language objects through the use of models. It also handles CRUD operations and database configurations
